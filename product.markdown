  title: Supplier Portal
  sub_heading: Put the procure-to-pay process on 'self-drive' using our Supplier Portal
    and Smart POs.
  description: The Supplier Portal makes Smart POs easily accessible for both suppliers
    and employees. The Smart PO pro-actively guides your suppliers and employees through
    the correct process every time. Once sent, we will make sure orders are completed
    until final payment with as little involvement from you as possible.

    description: |-
      Smart PO’s are available online or by API from requisition to final payment so there is always a “single version of the truth” between you and your supplier.

      So why does that matter? By having a single version of the truth, we can automatically verify invoices and other documents and send them back to the supplier if they are not correct. We can even generate the invoices ourselves.
    is_active: true
  - title: Order Tracking
    description: Smart PO’s don’t stop when the PO is sent. They stay alive until
      the final payment is confirmed so all parties always get a real-time view of
      the delivery, invoice approval and payment status.

  - title: Smart Terms
    description: Smart Terms not only describe the terms, but also make sure those
      terms are adhered to. Using Smart Terms, we know who needs to do what when so
      we can guide employees and suppliers through the correct process every time.
      This saves you time chasing people and gives you confidence processes are adhered
      to without requiring constant training.

  - title: Automated Alerting
    description: The Smart Terms also keep track of due dates for every process step.
      When actions do not happen on time, we will automatically alert the responsible
      people to remind them. This helps make sure orders never get stuck.

  - title: Messaging
    description: Our PO’s are smart, but they can’t resolve everything. Some issues
      can only be resolved by people. Every order has its own messaging channel allowing
      you, your supplier and anyone else in your company to resolve those issues.
      Centralised communications means you won’t have to trawl through lots of emails
      to get a status update.

  - title: Adaptive Format
    description: Different suppliers may want to receive the PO in different formats.
      Yordex will translate the PO to the format required by your suppliers, meaning
      less change for everyone involved.

      supplier forms. This will help you keep your business running smoothly by making
      sure we always capture the data you need.

  sub_heading: With a Supplier Portal in place, invoicing becomes a breeze. Yordex
    supports a range of invoicing options to suit every supplier.
  tabs:
  - title: Supplier Self Matching
    tab_id: pane-supplier-self-matching
    description: With this option your supplier uploads the invoice on the portal
      and matches it with the PO. They are asked to confirm the amount and payment
      due date matches with what we have on file. If not, they either change the invoice,
      or request a change to the order. If they request a change, the responsible
      employees have to approve that first. This avoids you ever getting invoices
      that don't match.

  - title: Self Billing
    tab_id: pane-self-billing
    description: In this option, we generate the invoice based on the original order
      and a confirmation of what was received. Unlike other self-billing systems,
      no special agreement is required for tax purposes. Because the supplier has
      an account on our portal, we still generate the invoice on behalf of the supplier.

  - title: Invoice Scanning

      the invoice as they do today. Yordex will scan it and match it with your PO’s.

    for approval.

    be done anytime, anywhere by email or from our mobile app.
