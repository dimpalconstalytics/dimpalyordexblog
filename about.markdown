  title: Our Story and Mission
  body: 'The idea for Yordex was born in early 2017 from from a simple question: why
    are businesses still struggling with invoices and manual processes while consumers
    can buy online with one click?'
story_mission_description: We believe the problem is the lack of a single, trusted
  "source of truth" for B2B orders. Buyer, seller and third parties all have their
  own copies of "the truth" (the order and its status) which are often incomplete
  and different. This leads to lots of extra work, uncertainty and errors. From this
  the idea of the Smart PO was born. Smart PO's provide a single source of the truth
  to help our customers save a lot of time, better manage cash and improve collaboration
  with suppliers. Smart PO's can also monitor and complete themselves allowing our
  customers to go from PO to final payment with the least amount of effort.

      title: Decentralised
      description: We not only believe in decentralised systems (Internet, Blockchain),
        we also believe in flat, self-managed organisations. In our opinion they provide
        the best way to stay service-centric and enjoy our work. Of course it is easy
        for a startup to be flat and self-managed, and we have worked in enough big
        companies to understand the lure of centralisation, but we are determined
        to make self-management work at Yordex no matter how big we get.
